      <p>
        Iâ€™m a full-stack developer with 1.5 years of hands-on experience
        crafting robust and innovative web solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        My curiosity drives me, not just to build, but to explore and discuss
        the ever-evolving world of technology.

        conversation and code something great together! This is more than just a
        portfolio; it's a glimpse into a journey of constant learning, growth,
